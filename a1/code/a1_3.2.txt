"As the number of training samples increases the value of the accuracy increases
until a saturation point, and then after that it tends to decrease.
The reason is that the smaller sample size of dataset is not able to capture the important aspects of each class
and can cause mis-classification and underfitting.
As the number of training samples increases, the characteristics of each class would be highlighted and enhance the
performance of the classification.
The accuracy is expected to decrease after some point because the model would be more complex and tend to overfit
the data."
